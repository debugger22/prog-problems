/*
Problem Statement
You are given an integer, N. Write a program to determine if N is an element of
the Fibonacci Sequence.
The first few elements of Fibonacci sequence are 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13....
A Fibonacci sequence is one where every element is a sum of the previous
two elements in the sequence. The first two elements are 0 and 1.
Formally:

fib0 = 0
fib1 = 1
fibn = fibn-1 + fibn-2 âˆ€ n > 1

Input Format

The first line contains T, number of test cases.
T lines follows. Each line contains an integer N.

Output Format
Display IsFibo if N is a Fibonacci number and IsNotFibo if it is not a Fibonacci number.
The output for each test case should be displayed in a new line.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 105
1 <= N <= 1010
